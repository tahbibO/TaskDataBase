            h3 Background 
            p Over the last few years, I wanted to track how long I spend on school assignments, personal projects, and general tasks. Previously, I have used methods like scheduling or pomodoro timers but I have found that they are not as flexible. I want to create a time tracking app that will track how users individually and in teams track their time. In order to create this full stack application, I will have to make use of a database. The goal of this project is to create a database that can store information on people, the tasks that they are working on, and sessions when they work.

            p This database is inherently storing personal data that is meant for personal use. All data that is stored can be removed by a user at any time. For this application all data will be visible through the front end but in a real life situation, such Person data would be hidden to all users except for the Person data relating to a user.
